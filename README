The Game
========
A 2D game where two snails fight to the death. :->

   


Design Guidelines
=================

Data
----
Data should flow, not be pushed/pulled! Chain consumers using delegates.
`std::cout << "hej" << std::endl;`
   
Classes
-------

Modules
-------
Don't create a lot of namespaces.
